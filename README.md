- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DoraDaDestr0yer!
    I'm a technical contractor in the Midwest United States. I'm currently pivoting from engineering roles to Technical Writing roles. I'm very excited about my future career opportunities!
    
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in, 
-   Sandbox games like Space Engineers brought me to GitHub. But my intrests range far beyond that, I'm a very active woman with interests including alpine skiing, sailing, and running. I'm also a maker! I finance this lifestyle by flipping Real Estate properties, which is super fun to begin with, but I also love woodworking, sewing, and travelling!


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# and Autohotkey, although programming languages are not my main focus right now. I want to learn to be a more effective writer and build a repository of writings in English instead of C#.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me, via email: Alexis.Kaas@Outlook.com
